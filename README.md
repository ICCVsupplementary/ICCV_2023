# A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Deepfake Generators: Dataset, Metrics Performance, and Comparative Analysis

This repository is currently under construction. We are actively working on adding content, code, and other resources to this project. Please bear with us while we build and improve the repository.

Please note that: The dataset structure follows the format of the original FaceScape dataset. This means that the data organization, file naming conventions, and directory structure are designed to be compatible with the FaceScape dataset for consistency and ease of use. Users should refer to the FaceScape documentation for further details on the dataset's specific attributes and their meanings. Link to FaceScape documentation: https://github.com/zhuhao-nju/facescape

Requirements:
ToDo
Python (>=3.6)
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy (numpy)
Pillow (PIL)
trimesh
pyrender


Real dataset
The source code can be used to generate real dataset


Synthesized dataset of MetaHumans
An example of MetaHuman synthesized dataset can be found in the following link, where we have 6 different characters sharing the same head pose and expression.

## A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Deepfake Generators: Dataset, Metrics Performance, and Comparative Analysis

This project is aimed at providing researchers and developers with a comprehensive toolkit to evaluate deepfake generators. We are actively working on adding content, code, and other resources to this project. Please bear with us while we build and improve the repository.

### Real dataset
Our dataset structure follows the format of the original FaceScape dataset, ensuring compatibility with FaceScape's data organization, file naming conventions, and directory structure for consistency and ease of use. For more detailed information on the dataset attributes and their meanings, please refer to the FaceScape documentation.

## Requirements
Before using the code and resources provided in this repository, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
Python (>= 3.6)
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy (numpy)
Pillow (PIL)
trimesh
pyrender
Real Dataset
Our source code includes tools to generate a real dataset, which can be a valuable asset for evaluating deepfake generators.

## Synthesized Dataset of MetaHumans
In addition to the Real dataset, we offer an example of a synthesized dataset of MetaHumans. This dataset comprises six different characters sharing the same head pose and expression. You can access the dataset through the following link: MetaHuman Synthesized Dataset.
