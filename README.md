This repository is currently under construction. We are actively working on adding content, code, and other resources to this project. Please bear with us while we build and improve the repository.

Feel free to check back later for updates or follow the repository to receive notifications when new content is added.

Thank you for your understanding and patience!



Please note that: The dataset structure follows the format of the original FaceScape dataset. This means that the data organization, file naming conventions, and directory structure are designed to be compatible with the FaceScape dataset for consistency and ease of use. Users should refer to the FaceScape documentation for further details on the dataset's specific attributes and their meanings.
